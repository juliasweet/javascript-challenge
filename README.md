Automatically-populated table of UFO sightings with multiple filters

This repository contains three folders, each representing a new level of search capabilities. 

Level One allows users to filter only by date. 

Level Two allows users to apply multiple progressive filters. (The second filter will add an additional layer to the data returned in the first search; to begin an entirely new search, you must reset the page.)

Level Three allows users to apply multiple filters at once and resets all filters for each new search. 

Many thanks to Brent Hillen for his help creating the initial table and filter for the Level 1 challenge, as well as affirming my suspicion that level 2 would involve a whole lot of copy and paste. 

Gratitude as well to Youa Thao, who helped me when I ran into trouble with the level two challenge. She reminded me that I needed to use an if to check for multiple filters and advised me to use let instead of var.

Finally, a huge bucket of kudos to the one, the only Nikhil of Stack Overflow. I had a most vexing problem with my filters, and none of the solutions that I had attempted were satisfactory. He offered two possible ways to address the problem, and I chose the one that made the most sense to me. Here is a link to my question and his answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945103/resetting-filters-before-adding-new-ones
